# Linux Terminal Configuration

Personal Linux-side development environment. Fish-first shell, modern CLI tools,
and a unified Rose Pine theme.

This repo intentionally manages only the Linux user environment. On Windows/WSL,
Windows Terminal, fonts, Warp, and other host-side settings are configured
outside this repo.

## Quick Setup

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/zhanghb18/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

Then ask an agent to read `CLAUDE.md` and set up the Linux environment.

## Terminal Stack

Read `docs/terminal-stack.md` for the current fish-based stack, install plan,
and host/Linux responsibility boundary.

## Principles

- Linux-side config only.
- Fish is the default interactive shell.
- No symlinks: copy reference files into their real config locations.
- Keep host terminal/app settings out of this repo.
- Prefer package-manager installs on Arch Linux.
- Keep existing machine-specific secrets and identities intact.
